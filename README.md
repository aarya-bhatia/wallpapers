# Wallpapers

Originally from DT's ( [Distrotube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) )wallpaper collection over on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers) I have added some more wallpapers on top of them.

Mostly these all are collected from various sources such as [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg) by DT and some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions installed over the years.

That said, I have added other pictures from Unsplash, Reddit's r/wallpapers and maybe such other sources.

If any of these images are for limited use or need attribution, let me know or file an issue, and I will gladly add attribution.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
